# ICS  (INTERNET CYBER SECURITY)
      Cyber security is the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices,
      electronic systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks. It's also known
      as information technology security or electronic information security.
      Network security is the practice of securing a computer network from intruders, whether
      targeted attackers or opportunistic malware.

·         Application security focuses on keeping software and devices free of threats.
A compromised application could provide access to the data its designed to protect. 
Successful security begins in the design stage, well before a program or device is deployed.

·         Information security protects the integrity and privacy of data, both in storage and in transit.

·         Operational security includes the processes and decisions for handling and protecting data assets.
The permissions users have when accessing a network and the procedures that determine how and where 
data may be stored or shared all fall under this umbrella.
